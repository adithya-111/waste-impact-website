# WordPress Portfolio Website

🔗 **Live Site:** [https://wasteimpacttrust.org/] and [https://reimaginewaste.org/]

## 🖥️ Description
Waste Impact is a responsive WordPress website developed for a community-driven organization that tackles societal waste challenges through youth engagement, innovation, and hackathons. The website was built using WordPress CMS, leveraging pre-built themes and essential plugins to ensure a modern, clean, and mobile-friendly user experience. I was responsible for designing the layout, uploading and organizing content, customizing pages to match the brand’s goals, and handling the complete deployment process. The site effectively communicates Waste Impact’s mission, showcases their events, and serves as an accessible platform for participants, partners, and the public to engage with their initiatives. This project highlights my ability to deliver well-structured WordPress solutions focused on usability, scalability, and impactful storytelling.
